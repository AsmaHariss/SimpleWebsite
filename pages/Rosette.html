    <b id="special">What are the features of the Rosette Nebula?</b></br>
    <p>
        This beautiful deep-sky object is a large nebula located in the constellation Monoceros. </br>
        It is a cosmic cloud of gas and dust that lies approximately 5000 light-years away and has</br>
        a flower-like appearance. What is this? The petals of this rose are actually a stellar </br>
        nursery where new stars are being born.

    <p>
        The nebula can't be seen with the naked eye, however, so you'll need a telescope to observe it.</br>

        Betelgeuse and Procyon.

    <b id="dead">What is the color of the Rosette Nebula?</b></br>
    <p>
        Since hydrogen is the most abundant element in nebulae such as the Rosette, the dominant color </br>
        of this nebula is red when viewed in a standard broadband image (taken by Wolfgang Promper). </br>
        However, other elements such as oxygen are present in the Rosette Nebula as well.
