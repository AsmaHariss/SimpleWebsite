    <b id="description">Description</b> </br></br>

    <p>The cast-off glowing gas is known as a planetary nebula. Therefore, planetary</br>
        nebulae are classified as emission nebulae, and are entirely unrelated to planets.</p></br>
    <b>Distance to Earth: </b>2,200 to 5,700 light years </br>
    <b>Discovered:</b> 1764, Charles Messier </br>
    <b>Density: 100 to 10,000 particles per cm3</b> </br>
    <b>Age: 20 000 years</b> </br><br></br>

    <b id="special">Why so special?</b></br>
    <p>
        Planetary nebulae probably play a crucial role in the chemical evolution of the </br>
        Milky Way by expelling elements into the interstellar medium from stars where those</br>
        elements were created. Planetary nebulae are observed in more distant galaxies, </br>
        yielding useful information about their chemical abundances.

    <b id="can">Can we see Planetary Nebula from Earth?</b></br>
    <p>
        yes amateur telescopes can be used to see planetary nebulas. Three that can be seen </br>
        visually are M27, M57, NGC 7293 using a telescope 6″ or greater. They are best seen </br>
        by photographing them.

    <b id="dead">Is the Planetary Nebula a dead star?</b><br>
    <p>
        When a medium-sized star begins to die, it sheds its outer layers forming a shell</br>
        of gas and dust called a “planetary nebula,” but the term is misleading. It comes from </br>
        late eighteenth century astronomers who thought their rounded shape looked similar to the</br>
        planet Uranus, discovered in 1781.
