    <b id="description">Description</b> </br></br>
    <p>Mz 3 is often referred to as the Ant Nebula because it resembles the head and thorax </br>
        of a garden-variety ant.</p>
    <b>Distance to Earth: </b>between 3,000 and 6,000 light years</br>
    <b>Radius: </b>1 light year</br>
    <b>Magnitude: </b>13.8</br>
    <b>Discovered: </b>1922</br>
    <b>Age: </b>1 light year</br></br></br>

    <b id="special">Characteristics</b></br>
    <p>
        Mz 3 is radially expanding at a rate of about 50 km/s and has its polar axis oriented at an</br>
        angle of around 30° from the plane of the sky (Lopez & Meaburn 1983; Meaburn & Walsh 1985). </br>
        It is sometimes compared to the more extensively studied Butterfly Nebula (M 2-9), and it is </br>
        quite likely that both have a similar evolutionary history.

    <p>
        Menzel 3, also called the Ant Nebula, lies about 3,000 light-years away in the southern </br>
        constellation Norma. At magnitude 13.8 and about 1′ across its longest dimension, it is a </br>
        faint target for observers. Like many obscure objects, this one reveals some amazing detail </br>
        only with large telescopes.
    </p></br></br></br>

    <b id="dead">What is the temperature of the Ant Nebula?</b></br>
    <p>
        The Ant Nebula is located about 5 000 light-years away. The central star is as bright as </br>
        10 000 Suns and has a temperature of 35 000 degrees Celsius
