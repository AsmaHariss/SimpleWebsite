    <b id="description">Description</b> </br></br>
    <p>A supernova remnant (SNR) is the structure resulting from the explosion of a </br>
        star in a supernova. The supernova remnant is bounded by an expanding shock wave, </br>
        and consists of ejected material expanding from the explosion, and the interstellar</br>
        material it sweeps up and shocks along the way.</p></br><br></br>

    <b id="special">What is one of the remnants of a supernova?</b><br>
    <p>
        With the advent of telescopes, astronomers connected this with a strangely shaped </br>
        cloud of gas they named the Crab Nebula. Today, we recognize the “star” was a </br>
        supernova, and the Crab Nebula is the supernova remnant.

    <b id="can">Can we see Supernova Remnant from Earth?</b></br>
    <p>
        Either their cosmic fireworks were hidden from our view by star fields or interstellar </br>
        gas and dust, or their occurrences predated the historical record. Only two supernova </br>
        remnants are realistic targets for most amateur telescopes, and they could not be more </br>
        different. Both inhabit our region of the galaxy.

    <b id="dead">IWhere are supernova remnants found?</b><br>
    <p>
        The youngest known supernova remnant in our galaxy is G1. 9+0.3, which is found in the </br>
        Milky Way's inner portion and is about 130 years old. However, observations of other</br>
        galaxies find that these other realms are home to many more supernova remnants than </br>
        are known in our galaxy.
